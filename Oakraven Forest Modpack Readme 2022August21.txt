=======================================
========= Custom POIS and RWG =========
=======================================

The Oakraven Forest Modpack incorporates a variety of custom POIs that are built into 7D2D's Random World Generator Tiling System.
In addition, Worlds are created with custom features in addition to regular default features.

Features and customisation is as follows:

- The Old West area of 7D2D has been expanded and has traders (An Old West Trading Town).
- Downtown has been totally removed because it can be quite heavy to render the POIs along with entities and NPCs at the same time.
- Custom POIs will appear within some of the default areas (residential, rural, commercial, etc) and allow in the Wilderness.

There is some crossover in the towns, districts, and areas above. 

================================================
=== (NPC Mod) 0-Score, 0-XNPCCore and Addons === 
================================================

The NPCMod is a community made asset that gives life to custom made NPCs, among many other features.
0-Score and 0-XNPCCore power the Addons compiled into 1-OakModpack. Addons have been compiled directly into the 1-OakModpack to reduce latency.
Care has been taken to ensure creators have been credited both in this Readme and within the xml files.

==================
== INSTALLATION ==
==================

For Players and Server Admin/Hosts who have never installed a mod before, here are some simple step by step instructions:

1. If you've never installed a mod before, it is necessary to create a Mods folder in the main directory, typically inside
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die. In the future, this location may change and we'll update instructions at that time.
If you have a custom install or your server host has modified the installation location, then you may have to explore.

2. Simply make a new folder called Mods (with a capital M to reflect standard nomenclature) in your '7 Days To Die' main directory folder.

3. You can now drag all of the mod folders directly out of the zipped file, and it can be placed directly into the Mods folder.

Does this Mod need to be installed in the server/client host? = YES
Do players also need to install this Mod? = YES (because it contains custom content that cannot be downloaded from the server).

* Launching the Modpack will require EAC to be set as False/Off due to the custom content.
