It is heavily influenced by Oakraven's Forest Collection and acts as a Modpack show case.

=======================================
====== Compopack 48 Fabbersville ======
=======================================

The Compopack is a well known and very well established 7D2D resource that allows custom POIs/Prefabs to be added to Worlds.
Submissions are made to the CP team and kept as intact as possible beyond carefull modification for quality and performance.
This Compopack Modlet contains POIs which are combined to be Fabbersville. Fabbersville provides a town and residential environment.
It is a more 'out of the city' environment built around the superb 7D2D A20 Tiling system.

Check them out here:
https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/21900-magolis-compo-pack-by-the-compopack/

None of the assets are edited in this Compopack 48 Fabbersville modlet, although there are some xml changes as follows:

- The Old West area of 7D2D allows traders to be added to their tiling system. (Just like a Western Trading Post)
- Country Town has been removed since Fabbersville serves a very similar purpose.
- Town has been removed since Fabbersville serves a very similar purpose.
- City has been removed to provide the 'out of the city' experience. 
- Commercial has been removed since Fabbersville serves a very similar purpose.
- Downtown has been removed since Fabbersville serves a very similar purpose.
- Industrial has been removed since Fabbersville serves a very similar purpose.
- Residential has been removed since Fabbersville serves a very similar purpose.
- Country Residential has been removed since Fabbersville serves a very similar purpose.
- Spawning has been customised to reflect town and residential areas that go beyond Biome spawn values. More urbanised areas see more zombies.

There is some crossover in the towns, districts, and areas above.

One thing that remains is 'Rural' area. POIs given this tag are generally placed as an outskirt 'District' for towns and cities.
This has been added as a 'District' for Fabbersville instead. This means that Fabbersville POIs will be more central in the tiling system.
7D2D 'Rural' tagged POIs will commonly be placed around the outside of the Fabbersville tiling system.
This creates some large townships with plenty of looting and quest potential but with gentler rendering and some delightful community made POIs. 

======================================
=== 0-Score, 0-XNPCCore and Addons === 
======================================

The NPCMod is a community made asset that gives life to custom made NPCs, among many other features.
0-Score and 0-XNPCCore power the Addons. This Modpack will follow the 0- (Core files), 1- (Addon files), and 2- (Expansion files) format.
This ensures load order is appropriate. However, the 1- (Addon files) are bundled directly into 1-OakModpackCore.
This helps to decrease load times due to less Localization files which can be surprisingly slow, and assist with overall efficiency.
Care has been taken to ensure creators have been credited both in this Readme and within the xml files.

===== Random Main Menu Background ===== 
=======================================

This modlet is cared for by closer_ex and provides Modpacks and Overhauls with a custom Main Menu Background image that is shown randomly.
This provides a very nice feature to personalise and highlight different aspects of what players can face.
It can be downloaded here, among many other delights. closer_ex combines modding with some complex coding, and has been very willing to assist other modders.

==================
== INSTALLATION ==
==================

For Players and Server Admin/Hosts who have never installed a mod before, here are some simple step by step instructions:

1. If you've never installed a mod before, it is necessary to create a Mods folder in the main directory, typically inside
\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die. In the future, this location may change and we'll update instructions at that time.
If you have a custom install or your server host has modified the installation location, then you may have to explore.

2. Simply make a new folder called Mods (with a capital M to reflect standard nomenclature) in your '7 Days To Die' main directory folder.

3. You can now drag all of the mod folders directly out of the zipped file, and it can be placed directly into the Mods folder.

Does this Mod need to be installed in the server/client host? = YES
Do players also need to install this Mod? = YES (because it contains custom content that cannot be downloaded from the server).
